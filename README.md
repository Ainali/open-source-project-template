# Open Source Project Template

This a template project. It's intention is to act as a practical helper and base line for when you want to release a project as Open Source.

Instructions

1. Create a new project, or prepare your old one.
2. Copy these files into the new project
3. Update the README, using the [README.template.md](README.template.md) and replace this README with that content.
4. Most other [Template Files](#template-files-explanation) can be used with minor modifications (see 5).
5. Correct any [Template Variables](#template-files-variables) in the Template files.
6. Remove any workflows that are not applicable for your application.(see .github/workflows)
6. If working with an existing code base, answer the questions on the [Open Source Checklist:](Open_Source_Checklist.md)
7. Continuing writing great software and tell people about it.

> Keep the README fresh! It's the first thing people see and will make the initial impression.
> If you cloned this project, DON'T forget to remove the .git-folder and create a new one with 'git init'. **You don't want to save this projects existing git history in your own project.**
> Understand the contents of the files you use from this project. Do they fit within your project, or are you looking for something else?
