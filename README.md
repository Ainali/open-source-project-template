# Open Source Project Template

This a template project containing 'Community Health Files' and Checklists. It's intention is to act as a practical helper and base line for when you want to release a project as Open Source. It is written in a general way as to be usable for anyone, and proposes well know conventions and de-facto standards when possible.
You are supposed to adjust them to your project needs if you use them.

Instructions

1. Create a new project, or prepare your old one.
2. Copy these files into the new project
3. Update the README, using the [README.template.md](README.template.md) and replace this README with that content.
4. Most other [Template Files](#template-files-explanation) can be used with minor modifications (see 5).
5. Correct any [Template Variables](#template-files-variables) in the Template files.
6. Remove any workflows that are not applicable for your application.(see the folder `.github/workflows`)
7. If working with an existing code base, answer the questions on the [Open Source Checklist:](Open_Source_Checklist.md)

> Keep the README fresh! It's the first thing people see and will make the initial impression.  
> If you cloned this project, DON'T forget to remove the .git-folder and create a new one with 'git init'.  
> Understand the contents of the files you use from this project. Do they fit within your project, or are you looking for something else?
