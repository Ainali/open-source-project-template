If you submit a PR to this project, a few checks will be run on it with CI.
However, you can (as in really should) run the same checks locally when you are happy
with your contribution, to avoid surprises.

== Code Quality Check

* Project quality tooling:
** https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter[megalinter] (various linter tools)
** https://github.com/fsfe/reuse-tool[reuse] (license compliance check)
** https://github.com/siderolabs/conform[conform] (commit check)

=== Code quality tools and test coverage

Run the code quality tooling check locally with the code-quality check script:
The script is dependent on https://podman.io/[podman].

[source,shell]
----
$ ./development/code_quality.sh
----
The resulting out put should be pretty self explantory.
Green and ok for passing checks, red and error for failing checks.
